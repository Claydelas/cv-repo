\subsubsection{About Me} \hfill \href{https://home-claydelas.vercel.app/}{\bf Personal Website}

Hello! I'm a recent graduate, that is now ready to dive into the world of professional Software Engineering. I'd like to think of myself as a creative person, who meets challenges with a smile. Working on complex and innovative projects excites me like few other things do. I'm eager to work in a team with like-minded people, where I have the opportunity to learn and grow as a person. I have a passion for exploring new technologies, solving real-life problems with code and automation.

When I'm taking a break from coding the next big thing, I like to enjoy a good time with my friends playing basketball, working on ourselves in the gym or competing in various video games as a team.

    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
        \item Designed and developed a novel platform for efficient text data annotation.
        \item Gained invaluable experience in project and time management, and learned to be self-reliant, as I worked independently to produce large-scale software.
        \item The project was recognised as ``extremely well engineered" and the research as ``convincing and worthy of publication" by examiners.\hfill \href{https://github.com/Claydelas/active-learning/blob/master/feedback/Examiner\%202\%20Project\%20Assessment\%20Form\%20by\%20dem\%20(DE\%20Millard).pdf}{\bf [feedback]}
        \item Using my product, teams can develop highly accurate machine learning models, while reducing the cost of data annotation by more than 50\% on average.
        \item Learned complex topics in a short amount of time through systematic research.
    \end{itemize}
\item[] \boldy{Advertisement Campaign Dashboard}\hfill \href{https://github.com/Claydelas/dashboard-fx}{\bf Source}
    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
        \item Worked in a team of 5 to produce deliverables in biweekly sprints, following Scrum and Agile practices.
        \item Collaborated with a client weekly to discuss the product's direction and vision.
        \item Largely took on the role of project lead, guiding the team to success.
        \item Solely responsible for the development of the product's front end and database.
        \item Carried out qualitative research to inform UX, UI and accessible design choices.
    \end{itemize}
\item[] \boldy{Securing Web/Cloud Applications}\hfill \href{https://github.com/Claydelas/web-sec}{\bf Source}
    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
        \item Systematically analysed security flaws via penetration testing with Kali Linux.
        \item Followed best practices to protect client assets and fix security vulnerabilities.
        \item Employed a test-driven development process to ensure better risk mitigation.
    \end{itemize}
\item[] \boldy{Streamless, My Personal Programming Language}\hfill \href{https://github.com/Claydelas/streamless}{\bf Source}
    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
        \item Developed a domain-specific programming language, interpreted in pure Haskell.
        \item Studied core programming language concepts, allowing me to apply my existing knowledge to quickly learn new frameworks and languages.
